# Find Nearest Vowel Kata

This repo contains my code for solving the [Find Nearest Vowel Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6158805b7b10b80007ce2c72).

This is a simple Node project with `jest` being the only dependency.

All coding was done using **TDD**

Strategy
- Create code and test files
- Create function
- Code for empty string returns empty array
  - Completly empty
  - Spaces
- Code for param validations
  - null or undefined
  - Too long
  - Special characaters
  - Spaces
  - No vowel in string
- Develop initial logic
- Initial logic tests
  - Zeros for vowels
  - Non-vowel with vowel before
    - Imediately before
    - More than 1 place before
  - Non-vowel with vowel after
    - Imediately after
    - More than 1 place after
- Improve logic if needed and re-test
